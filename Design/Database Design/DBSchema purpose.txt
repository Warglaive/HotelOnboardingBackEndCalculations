Directus CMS means - cms.vialuxury.com
CMS will receive data(draft hotels and packages) from the Onboarding app

The purpose of the DBSchema is
to be sure that the data you collect matches the data that our cms needs to publish packages.
in principle the schema does not have to match, but it makes life a lot easier. If that makes sense?
