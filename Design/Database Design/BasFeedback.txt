Extra's can be chosen for each package. If they are chosen, they get connected to an order.

Extra's are not mandatory, except for one specific setting we are using.

Extra's are like 'A champagne bottle on the room'


We do have something like black friday deals, and for those deals we make a few extra's mandatory. Like 'Dinner for 2'.
But perhaps this case is not 100% mandatory just for now. But good to bear in mind. (black friday deals are 'rooms for "free"')

Also, to make it a bit more complicated, we may have extra's that are mandatory only for check-ins on say Friday and Saturday.
